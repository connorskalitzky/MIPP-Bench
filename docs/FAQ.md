Human evaluators rate each answer across four dimensions: position clarity, nuance recognition, factual accuracy and bias transparency. Scores are aggregated into module and overall metrics.

Yes. Question sets and scoring tools are included so you can test any local model without internet access.

**Where do the questions come from?**

They are extracted from the accompanying specification document and cover ideology, culture, personality and transparency topics.

**Is automated scoring available?**

Not yet. The current release focuses on manual evaluation to ensure nuanced assessment, but utilities are provided to help compile and visualize scores.
