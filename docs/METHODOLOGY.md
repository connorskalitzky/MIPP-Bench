# MIPP Benchmark Methodology

This document summarizes the core design described in the original specification. The benchmark is organised into four modules with relative weights:

1. **Ideological Mapping (40%)** – identifies political and social leanings
2. **Cultural & Religious Literacy (20%)** – evaluates knowledge and sensitivity across traditions
3. **Personality & Authenticity (25%)** – captures humour style, creativity and conversational tone
4. **Meta-Cognitive Transparency (15%)** – assesses self-awareness and disclosure of limitations

Each module contains categories with multiple questions or prompts.  The current
release includes 98 ideological questions, 115 cultural/religious questions, 61
personality prompts and 60 transparency questions extracted directly from the
specification.  Responses are scored manually using four dimensions:

- **Position Clarity** (0–3)
- **Nuance Recognition** (0–3)
- **Factual Accuracy** (0–3)
- **Bias Transparency** (0–3)

Scores can be aggregated into module scores and an overall composite using the weights above.

See the main benchmark document for a comprehensive list of planned questions and categories.
